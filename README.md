This software is to test interactions of 5G (30mm waves) with differing materials.

- handle high frequency simulations
- material property setpoints such as permittivity, permeability, and conducitivty
- wave propagation analysis such as diffraction, reflection, refraction, and absorption
- visualization tools
- uniform distribution of 5g signal
- placement of different materials (like reflectors, dielectrics, plastics, glasses) in a specific pattern can create a pathway for the signal to travel efficiently.
